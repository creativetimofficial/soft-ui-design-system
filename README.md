Soft UI Design System is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented. This Freebie Bootstrap 5 UI Kit is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

#### Special thanks
During the development of this design system, we have used many existing resources from awesome developers. We want to thank them for providing their tools open source:
- [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - Kickass library used to manage poppers
- [CountUp](https://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js/) - Dependency-free, lightweight JavaScript class that can be used to quickly create animations that display numerical data in a more interesting way
- [Rellax](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/) - Lightweight, vanilla javascript parallax library
- [Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) - A lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor links
- [Nepcha Analytics](https://nepcha.com?ref=readme) for the analytics tool. Nepcha is already integrated with Soft UI Design System. You can use it to gain insights into your sources of traffic.

Let us know your thoughts below. And good luck with development!
